A Python 3 notebook that creates a heat map from CASP .rr files. Only PFRMAT RR is supported. For format info, please see http://predictioncenter.org/casp13/index.cgi?page=format

DeepMind's [AlphaFold](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/alphafold_casp13) outputs .rr contact maps. This script will visualize them.

To run, install seaborn and change the path name in the script where it opens the file. Run in your favorite notebook platform (I used [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html). You can also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
