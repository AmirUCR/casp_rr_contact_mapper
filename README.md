A Python 3 notebook that creates a heat map from CASP .RR files

DeepMind's [AlphaFold](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/alphafold_casp13) outputs .rr contact maps. This script will visualize them.

To run, install seaborn and change the path name in the script where it opens the file.
